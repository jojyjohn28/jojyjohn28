I am a passionate researcher in the field of Microbial Ecology, with a keen interest in understanding how microbes thrive and interact within their ecosystems using OMICs technologies. My work explores the intricate mechanisms through which microorganisms sustain their communities and adapt to environmental changes.

Currently, I am involved in a multidisciplinary project that investigates the Drivers of Functional Redundancy across Microbiomes. My goal is to establish an innovative pipeline that leverages multi-OMICs approaches to calculate functional redundancy, providing deeper insights into the stability and resilience of microbial ecosystems.

In my research, I strive to push the boundaries of microbial ecology and contribute to our understanding of microbial dynamics on a systems level.
