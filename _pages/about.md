### Current Research & Projects

#### Investigating Functional Redundancy Across Microbiomes
Currently working on a multidisciplinary project that explores the **Drivers of Functional Redundancy** in microbiomes. This project focuses on:
- Understanding functional redundancy through **multi-OMICs approaches**.
- Studying microbial stability and resilience in diverse ecosystems.
- Exploring the role of Fred in recovery of microbiome after a irreversible distrubence in the ecosytem
