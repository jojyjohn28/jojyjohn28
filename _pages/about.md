I am a passionate researcher in the field of **Microbial Ecology**, with a keen interest in understanding how microbes thrive and interact within their ecosystems using **OMICs technologies**. My work explores the intricate mechanisms through which microorganisms sustain their communities and adapt to environmental changes.

Currently, I am involved in a multidisciplinary project that investigates the **Drivers of Functional Redundancy across Microbiomes**. My goal is to establish an innovative pipeline that leverages **multi-OMICs approaches** to calculate functional redundancy, providing deeper insights into the stability and resilience of microbial ecosystems.

In my research, I strive to push the boundaries of microbial ecology and contribute to our understanding of microbial dynamics on a systems level.
