## Background
Life in salt pans with varying chemical compositions requires unique adaptation strategies at both the physiological and molecular levels. The Marakkanam salt pan in South India is characterized by a high fluctuation in salinity (19â€“490 ppt), ultraviolet radiation, and heavy metal concentrations.Several bacterial species have been isolated and identified through phylogenetic analysis for the subsequent production of industrially important enzymes. However, limited information exists on the genomic basis of their survival under variable environmental conditions. In this context, I am interested in characterizing cultivable and uncultivable halophilic bacteria inhabiting the Marakkanam saltpan located in south India and using one abundant strain (Salinivibrio) as a model organism to understand the genomic basis of adaption under varying stress.
