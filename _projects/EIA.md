## Background
The deep and open oceans are home to a major part of the world's biodiversity with the deep sea covering 65% of the earth's surface and being the world's largest ecosystem. These extreme environments are characterized by low oxygen supply, high pressure,low temperature and limited food supply. Diversity of ocean sediments and polymetallic nodules (PMN) from the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) is scarcely characterized and molecular studies are lacking. This knowledge is essential for learing the effect of mining on the bio fauna.Thus, in this work, I aminterested in the deep-sea biodiversity using eDNA metabarcoding of the V9 region of the 18S rRNA for eukaryotes, and 16S rRNA for microbes.
