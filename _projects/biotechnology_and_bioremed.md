## Background
n recent years, halophillic bacterial strains have shown promise in different biotechnological and bioremediation potential. In this context , here I have studied biotechnological potential of many moderately halophilic bacteria including enzyme production, hydrocarbon degrdation, PGPR production, and antagonistic activity
