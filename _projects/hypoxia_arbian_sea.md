## Background
The Arabian sea experiences hypoxia due to upwelling, which is mainly influenced by the southward movement of the West Indian coastal current during the South West Monsoon (SWM) . The upwelled waters are already hypoxic (<2 mL L-1) as these are from the thermocline region off the continental shelf of India. During the SWM, the bottom waters having low oxygen levels profoundly impact the biogeochemistry and ecological functioning of the biome and the underlying sediments. Thus, I am interested to understand how the microbiome change with monsoon and how they overcome the energy limit hypoxic conditions of the sea.
